<!-- ## We can also install some useful programs into our environment
 
A benefit of Anaconda is that someone out there has already created installation scripts for an increasing number of packages.
It will take a few minutes to run the following code, but you'll end up with a useful image package in native bash


~~~ bash 
conda install imagemagick

<!-- 1. Refactor and outsource code into modules. Every time you copy and paste a piece of code, you should consider replacing it with a function. This will not only make your notebook more readable, but also make fixing errors easier. -->

## Creating a report structure
**The report** is a polished version of your study and is intended for collaboration and review. Making a habit of aggregating useful discoveries into a single report notebook used for communication with colleagues can save you a lot of time!
If you follow the following structure for the final project for this course, you can easily convert your report into an article.

## Report structure 
1. Title   
1. Short introduction that has the following sections:
    - Background (The general context and the specific area of this report)
    - The problem or question you wish to address  
    - The data and methods you are using to answer your questions
    - Summarizes your main result and explain your results in relation to your questions.
    - Discuss how your findings compare to existing knowledge? 
1. Data overview that has the following information
    - Where is the data from 
    - Sample size
    - Group/condition of intrest
    - A full description of the other covariates of intrest
    - What metrics are you using and how were they extracted
1. Methods
    - What are the different methods used in this report 
    - Briefly explain what they do and why they will be suitable for you to answer your questions.
1. Results 
   - There should be a clear title for each result section that guides the reader through the results in context.
   - Start the text with a question
   - Then add a sentence explaining what you did and how
   - Report the findings
   - Tie them to previous research with some references (at least one).
1. Conclusion   
    - State your most important results in the Conclusion section. 
    - Make sure you do not simply summarize your findings - interpret the findings at a higher level of abstraction. 
    - What are the limitations of your study? 
    - Do you believe you did an adequate job of answering the questions stated in the introduction in light of the limitations? 
    - Lastly, what suggestions do you have for future research?
