## Introductions
Hello everyone and welcome to the Data Science Bootcamp. I am Dr Eyal Soreq, your instructor for this course. During this course, you will learn how to apply modern data science methods to neurocognitive issues, including how to create reusable data-driven reports using the GWDG Jupyter cloud. The course aims to teach you some of the analytical skills you need to complete your PhD.

## Advice On Benefiting The Most From The Course
Aside from wishing you a warm welcome, I want to share some helpful tips for completing this course. At this point, you should have a lot of experience with online courses. Online courses, in my opinion, require different skills from students and provide a new way of studying. Being an online learner means you must be self-motivated and disciplined. Consequently, it's your responsibility to establish and maintain a regular study schedule.

## Collaborate And Share Ideas, Code, Examples Etc.
A key factor for course success is completing all assignments. Collaboration with your classmates is not only permitted, but I encourage it. Getting a deeper understanding of something is best achieved by successfully teaching it to someone else. Even so, you will find that the course is designed in such a way that each assignment is personalized.

## Ask Questions!
I canâ€™t stress this enough, you are in your very first steps in what I hope will become a fruitful career. However, you will soon find that in most cases, the technical, programmatic and even theoretical problems you encounter are not unique. Learn from other people experience.

## Know When To Give Up And Ask For Help!
When you search online for more than 15 minutes and get no relevant result, you might be asking the wrong questions. If you spend more than an hour trying to solve a problem using online sources and nothing works, it might be useful to ask a friend, a supervisor, or collaborator.

## Feedback
As you know, the course also has a [blackboard site](https://virtualcampus.maxplanckschools.org/course/view.php?id=96#section-1). Please give us feedback on how to improve the course, it will benefit you immediately.


## What Will be covered

Our focus in this five-day course is to learn how to use [gwdg Jupyter-cloud](https://jupyter-cloud.gwdg.de/welcome/) as your primary analytical tool. The first day of this class will cover how to set up your environment and how to manage your filesystem in Bash. You will also learn how to use Markdown to write text, and you will be given additional resources to help you with your self-learning. Day two is dedicated to Vanilla Python. The third day will cover Pandas, a tool useful for working with tabular datasets and more. The fourth day is dedicated to Numpy, the de-facto standard for numerical analysis in Python. The final part of the week will be devoted to Data Visualisation theory and practice.   

## What We Leave Out

We will **not** be going over how to use the gwdg [HPC hub](https://jupyter-hpc.gwdg.de/hub/login). I will also not profess to train you to be experts in data science (that's what a PhD is for). This course is designed to give you a strong foundation on which you can build.

If you feel there is a particular topic that you would like me to cover or expand on, you can let me know by leaving a comment on the feedback section of the blackboard site. 


## Let us Get Started

Now that we have a road map of what we are covering
we are ready to begin our training. Our goal is that by the end, you will
have acquired some new knowledge, confidence, and skills that you can
use in your teaching practice in general and in teaching Carpentries
workshops specifically.
