Plan your 30 minutes, roughly 20-25 minutes of talk with slides, and 5+ minutes of questions and discussion.
Your talk should have the following sections: 

- In general, what the paper is trying to say
- Additional background needed to fully understand the paper's topic 
- Aims of the paper
- The methods used
- Results
- Comparison and evaluation of methods
- Conclusions (from the study)
- Critique (from you)
- A summary/conclusion (from you)
- Current state of the art and/or future directions
